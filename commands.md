3. create a mock server(db.json file at the root level)
4. pnpm install json-server --save-dev (To simulate a server, you can use a package like json-server to serve the db.json file.) Mock server
5. "scripts": {
  "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000",      // script added

10. pnpm install @ant-design/icons --save
11. pnpm install dotenv --save-dev // information available below , and put the .env in gitignore
12. pnpm add -g pnpm  // to update the pnpm






##  
Root Directory:

    node_modules/: Dependencies
    public/: Static assets like images
    src/: Source code
    db.json: Mock database file
    index.html: Entry HTML file
    package.json: Project metadata and dependencies
    vite.config.js: Vite configuration

Inside src/:

    components/: Reusable UI components (e.g., BookCard.jsx)
    pages/: Route-specific components (e.g., Home.jsx)

    Analogy:

Imagine you're baking a cake (building a component) and you need sugar (another component). You go to the kitchen cabinet (import statement) to get the sugar (Button component).



# #############  
Use dotenv (Optional):
If you want to continue using the dotenv package in your local development environment to load environment variables from the .env file, follow these steps:

Install the dotenv package as a development dependency:

bash
Copy code
npm install dotenv --save-dev
In your main application file (e.g., index.js or App.js), import and configure dotenv at the top:

javascript
Copy code
require('dotenv').config();
This step ensures that your local development environment can still access the environment variables from the .env file.

Command Explanation: cd /d C:\

cd: This is a command in the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux/Unix) that stands for "Change Directory." It's used to navigate between folders or directories.
/d: This is an option or switch for the cd command in Windows. It tells the command to also change the current drive letter. In this case, it's specifying that we want to switch to the "C:" drive.
